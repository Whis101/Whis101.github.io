# ABOUT ME
<p> My name is Dave Brown, and I am a student majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science with a strong passion for solving real-world problems through analytical thinking and programming. I am fascinated by the challenge of taking complex systems apart, understanding how they work, and building solutions that are both elegant and effective. My academic journey has been shaped by a commitment to discipline, focus, and continuous learning, and I am constantly seeking out opportunities to sharpen my skills and deepen my understanding of the subjects I love.

Alongside my technical interests, I have a deep appreciation for art, which offers a creative balance to the structure and logic of math and programming. I believe that artistic thinking can enhance the way we solve problems by encouraging new perspectives and more flexible approaches. Whether I am writing code, studying abstract concepts, or creating art, I aim to bring curiosity, patience, and intention to everything I do. For me, learning is not just a task; it is a mindset and a lifelong pursuit. </p>
